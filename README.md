### MonoNav: camera-based real-world navigation using object recognition.

This is a side project aims to approaching camera-based real-world navigation using object recognition. A floor detection neural network is used to extract the planar walkable region from a monocular camera after which a occupancy grid map is generated. Path planning, trajectory interpolation and LQR control are applied under visual feedback.
